# postbop
Follow on project of the prebop project

## intro
This project clones Bob Foster's, apparently no longer supported, [PreBop](https://sourceforge.net/projects/prebop/)
preprocessor project in order to provide
bug fixes and support to the code base.

This project provides a simple code preprocessor for java and xml files much like the c preprocessor does for C and C++.  This preprocessor
is currently not as functional as the C preprocessor, but it does provide conditional compilation using XML- and Java-friendly comments
that should come in handy supporting Maven projects.  See the documentation below for more information.

## license
Bob's code has a CPL license on it so we'll continue to use that.  (CPL is the predecessor of the Eclipse Public License.)

## contributing
Bug reports and fixes are welcome.  Please use normal github processes to help out.

## documentation

- [prebop](http://prebop.sourceforge.net/) - original prebop documentation which largely also still applies to postbop
