# postbop
Follow on project of the prebop project

## intro
This project clones Bob Foster's, apparently no longer supported, [PreBop](https://sourceforge.net/projects/prebop/)
preprocessor project in order to provide
bug fixes and support to the code base.



## license
Bob's code has a CPL license on it so we'll continue to use that.  (CPL is the predecessor of the Eclipse Public License.)

## contributing
Bug reports and fixes are welcome.  Please use normal github processes to help out.
